# fitpay-test
# FitPay Code submission for QA postion

To run (assuming that you have maven installed), you should be able to download the project and run the command `mvn clean test` against the root, which will build the project and run all tests. 

The (hardcoded) token will expire tonight around 8, if you need me to update it and repush, no problem, just let me know. 

See [subscription_spec.rb](/wizproperties/fitpay-test/tree/master/FitPay/src/test/java/FitPayTest/TestAll.java) for more detailed info.
